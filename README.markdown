The main reason I used Buddy Rich as the subject for the tribute page is that his music was my inspiration for taking up the drums 25 years ago. Jazz drumming quickly turned to rock, but Buddy Rich's style, although incomparable and unacheivable for a mere drum-peasant like myself, was always in my mind whilst learning to play.

This task I really enjoyed taking me out of my comfort zone with HTML/CSS. I found that I was forced to learn at a much faster rate than just answering questions. I'd love to specd more time on this soon, i'm sure i'll come back to it but JavaScript awaits!
