      <li><strong>1921</strong> - As a child prodigy at only 2 years old, played on Broadway under the name "Baby Traps the drum wonder"</li>
      <li><strong>1932</strong> -  At fifteen he led & toured a band across the US and Australia, becoming the second highest paid child entertainer behind Jackie Coogan during the 1930s.</li>
      <li><strong>1937</strong> - Jazz career begins with clarinetist Joe Marsala. Became a member of big bands led by Bunny Berigan and Artie Shaw.</li>
      <li><strong>1942</strong> - Rich left the Dorsey band to join United States Marine Corps, in which he served as a judo instructor and never saw combat. He was discharged in 1944 for medical reasons. After leaving the Marines, he returned to the Dorsey band.</li>
      <li><strong>1946</strong> - With financial support from Frank Sinatra, he formed a band and continued to lead bands intermittently until the early 1950s.  </li>
      <li><strong>1950's</strong> - Rich was a frequent guest on The Steve Allen Show and other television variety shows, most notably on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Rich and Johnny were lifelong friends, and Johnny Carson was himself a drum enthusiast.</li>
      <li><strong>1950's</strong> - In addition to playing with Benny Carter Buddy continued his rise in the industry through collaborations with Harry James (1953â€“56), Les Brown, Charlie Ventura, Jazz at the Philharmonic, and Charlie Parker (Bird and Diz, 1950).</li>
      <li><strong>1955</strong> - Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa recorded theie iconic collaboration album titled, "Krupa and Rich", which featured the song "Bernie's Tune", where they traded drum solos for a total of six minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>1966</strong> - He performed a big-band arrangement of a medley from West Side Story that was released on the 1966 album Swingin' New Big Band. The "West Side Story Medley", arranged by Bill Reddie, highlighted Rich's ability to blend his drumming into the band. Rich received the West Side Story arrangement of Leonard Bernstein's melodies from the musical in the mid-1960s; he found the music quite challenging and it took him almost a month of constant rehearsal to perfect. It later became a staple of his live performances.</li>
      <li><strong>1968</strong> - Made a live recording of the "Channel One Suite" on the album Mercy, Mercy recorded at Caesars Palace. The album was acclaimed as the "finest all-round recording by Buddy Rich's big band".</li>
      <li><strong>1987</strong> - Rich continued to play and tour well into his 60's, suffering paralysis from a suspected stroke whilst on tour in New York. He was admitted to hospital and died a month later from complications attributed to a brain tumour.</li>
